## Info

Source code: https://github.com/lenguyen1807/mnist-cpp

Tutorial:  [CÃ¹ng mÃ¬nh xÃ¢y dá»±ng Neural Network Ä‘Æ¡n giáº£n (Pháº§n 1)](/blog/cpp-nn) (only in Vietnamese for now, my English writing is terrible ðŸ¥²).

What I've done:
- Hello

What I've learnt:
- Hello

What can be improved:
- Implement mini-batch.
- Implement momentum to SGD.
- Implement more optimization algorithm (AdaGrad, AdamW).
- Implement Dropout (prevent overfitting).
- Implement Batch Normalization.
- Use GPU (otherwise multi-thread on CPU).
