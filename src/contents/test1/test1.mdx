description: In March, Google released a new Core Web Vital called Interaction to Next Paint (INP). It measures the speed of interactions with the website. In this article, you’ll learn more about INP from the developer’s perspective. I’ll guide you through testing for INP, verifying potential causes of low INP scores, and how you can leverage new React tools to optimize your website for recent changes.

This is theorem and proof:
<MdxMathBlock type="theorem">
The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ are uncountable.
</MdxMathBlock>

<MdxMathBlock type="proof">
If $\mathbb{R}$ is countable, then [0, 1] is countable as well. Hence there exists a map C from $\mathbb{N}$ onto [0, 1] with $$C(n)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} c_{i}(n) 10^{-i}$$ where $c_{i}(n) \in\{0,1, \ldots, 9\},$ are the digits in decimal expansion. Now consider a real number $$x=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \bar{c}_{i} 10^{-i}\in[0,1]$$ with $\bar{c}_{i} \neq c_{i}(i)$. Obviously $C(n) \neq x$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N} .$ Hence $C$ is not onto. A contradiction.
</MdxMathBlock>

<MdxMathBlock type="theorem">
If $S$ is both countable and infinite, then there is a bijection between $S$ and $\boldsymbol{N}$ itself [^1].
</MdxMathBlock>

<MdxMathBlock type="lemma">
An even number plus an even number results in an even number.
</MdxMathBlock>

<MdxMathBlock type="definition">
A definition is a a statement of the meaning of a word or word group or a sign or symbol [^2].
</MdxMathBlock>

This is a list:
- Hihi
- Huhu

This is number list:
1. Hihi
2. Huhu

Cứ quên anh vậy đi
Nhạt nhoà sương tan ái ân mây trôi buồn
Những môi hôn chìm sâu
Còn đâu nụ cười thơ ngây đó
Cứ xa anh vậy đi
Đường mòn xưa kia dẫn lối đôi chân lẻ loi
Anh lẻ loi

This is inline math: $f(x) = 2x^2 + 3$

This is block math:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathcal{N}(x \mid \mu, \sigma^2)
$$

This is footnote [^1].

This is python code:
```python
def HelloWorld():
  print("hello world")
```

This is typescript code:
```ts
export function Hihi(name: string) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`)
}
```

This is inline code `print("Helloworld")`.

This is **bold** text and this is *italic* text.
